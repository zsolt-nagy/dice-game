- 2 players
- Each round, the player rolls the dice as many times as he/she wishes.
  The result of each roll is added to the player's score for that round.
- If the player rolls 1, all of his points are lost and he/she passes the roll to the other player.
- The player can also select the 'KEEP' button.
  In this case, the number of points scored in that round will be added to the player's total points.
  The roll then passes to the other player.
- The player who reaches 100 points first wins.
